"When issues of significant moral value can be related to safety

they become widely accessible."

* Jared Garfinkel

## Bio

***

Jared Garfinkel recently received a Master of Science (M.S.) 

degree in Biostatistics from Columbia University and is currently

seeking a scientific role doing a public service in academia 

or the public sector. The work before Garfinkel is to challenge

the public to build the economy that cares for everyone.

***

Public health efforts across time have provided much needed support 

for advancing scientific solutions in times of political and 

social distress. Few inventions have given rise to gains in living 

conditions for more individuals than running water and sanitation.  

Garfinkel hopes to imagine a world in which maternal health is made 

a priority even in times of climate  change and global pandemic.

***

Garfinkel began to study epidemics as early as 4th grade, having 

turned in a poster board on the mysteries surrounding the Bubonic 

Plague. It was Garfinkel’s dream to become an expert in public health.

In high school, Garfinkel continued to pursue public health by taking

a class in public health theory at a summer program at Columbia 

University. Then as part of his first master's degree, Garfinkel 

connected his interest in public health to sustainability through

the Sustainable Development Goals.

***

Biostatistics bridges Garfinkel's appreciation for mathematics

and data collection with his life mission to end climate change and

stop racism. Throughout Garfinkel's academic and professional career,

the primary focus has been to prepare to decide to tackle these 

tough issues. Through public health solutions, Garfinkel wants to live 

in a world where children are free from environmental harm and 

one's zip code does not predict one's longevity and earning potential.

While climate change has and will continue to affect the work 

public health practitioners do, it was Garfinkel’s dedication to social 

equity that drove him back to public health.
