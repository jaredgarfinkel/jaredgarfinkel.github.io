## Bio

Jared Garfinkel is a candidate for a Master of Science (M.S.) 

in Biostatistics at Columbia University seeking a scientific 

role doing a public service in the nonprofit or government sectors. 

Garfinkel began to study epidemics as early as 4th grade, having 

turned in a project on the mysteries surrounding the bubonic 

plague. It was Garfinkel’s dream to become an expert in public health.

Garfinkel followed his curiosity about climate change and 

eventually achieved a Master of Arts (M.A.) in Sustainability 

from Hofstra University on Long Island. While climate change 

has and will continue to affect the work public health 

practitioners do, it was Garfinkel’s curiosity about social 

equity that drove him back to public health. 

Few inventions have given rise to gains in living conditions 

for more individuals than running water and sanitation. Public 

health efforts across time have provided much needed support 

for advancing scientific solutions in times of political and 

social distress. Garfinkel hopes to imagine a world in which 

maternal health is made a priority even in times of climate 

change and global pandemic.
